# Automated-Door-Opening-System
# Introduction:
The Smart Automatic Door System is an IoT-based project designed to automate door operations using an IR sensor, servo motor, and ESP8266 WiFi module. The system detects a person using an IR sensor and automatically opens the door. It also allows remote control via WiFi, making it suitable for smart homes, offices, hospitals, and public spaces.

# Objectives:
The objective is to provide easy, contactless, and secure door access while improving accessibility, cost effective and energy efficiency.

# Applications:
• Smart homes & offices
• Hospitals & public spaces
• Secure areas like banks & labs. 
This system enhances convenience, security, and hygiene, making it an ideal automation solution for modern environments.

# Components used:
1) IR sensor
2) ESP8266
3) Servo Motor

# Working:
The IR sensor detects a person near the door and sends a signal to the ESP8266. The ESP8266 processes the signal and commands the servo motor to rotate, opening the door. After a short delay, the servo rotates back to close the door. The ESP8266 can also connect to Wi-Fi for remote monitoring or control.

# Future Improvement:
Future automated doors will be smarter, energy-efficient, safer, more accessible, and connected to smart systems with AI-powered sensors and remote monitoring.
